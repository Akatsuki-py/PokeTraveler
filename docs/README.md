# PokeTraveler

**Note: This project is still in progress!**

A game that just roams the world of Pokemon GSC.

You don't have Pokemon and can just concentrate on enjoying walking around the Pokemon world!

You can edit the world as you like by editing the asset folder.

Currently there is no other way than editing json directly, but we will add a GUI editing screen in a future update.

## Usage

```sh
$ make build
$ ./poketraveler
```
